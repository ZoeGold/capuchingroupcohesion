Zoë Goldsborough, Margaret C. Crofoot, Julián León, Pedro Luis Castillo-Caballero, Evelyn Del Rosario-Vargas, and Brendan J. Barrett.

Contains the R script containing all analyses ("cohesionanalyses.R"), as well as the raw data from two grids of camera traps as .csv and .RDS files, one aggregated to the level of the sequence ("gridsequence") and one where each row is an observation of an animal ("gridclean").
